# How to edit SuperMemo.wiki

### Requirements

#### Validate with us the changes you want to apply

Make sure that you either:
- Edit the wiki to address an issue that has already been accepted,
- Open an issue **beforehand** to validate with us the nature and the reasons for the changes you want to apply.

#### Technical requirements

The minimum requirement is an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/) in order to send us your changes to the wiki.

### Setup

#### Forking the Documentation

After logging in to your GitHub account:
1. Visit the [official wiki repository](https://github.com/supermemo/Documentation). This repository contains the documentation for both [SuperMemo](https://www.supermemo.wiki) and [SuperMemo Assistant](https://www.supermemo.wiki/sma).
2. Click on the Fork button at the top right of your screen. This will create create a new, personal version of the repository on your account.

> [!NOTE]
> Your repository should be available at `github.com/<YourUsername>/Documentation/`, provided you didn't change the name of the repository.

#### Setting up Docsify on your computer

If your edit is simple and less than a few paragraphs worth, you may skip this step and go to [Editing on GitHub](#on-github).

⚠️ This section is a work in progress.

### Editing the wiki

#### On GitHub

##### Editing the wiki on GitHub

!> Only edit on GitHub if your edit **really is** minor. For larger modifications, we require that you set up a local version of the documentation on your computer. This enables you to validate the visual result of your changes on the website, in real-time.

1. On GitHub, navigate to your forked repository, and select the `docs` folder. 

![Docs Folder](content/images/editing-the-wiki/docsfolder.png)

2. Find the file you want to edit. For example, if you are looking to edit the installation page, you would select the `qs-installation.md` page.

> [!TIP]
> - To know which page a specific part of the wiki belongs to, navigate to wiki and look for the name of the file in your browser's url (e.g. the backup setup page's url is `https://supermemo.wiki/sma/#/qs-backup-setup`, and its file name is `qs-backup-setup.md`.
> - To find a page on GitHub, use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>F</kbd> to open up the search box. Type the name (or a part of the name) of the page and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

3. Click the pencil icon to enable the editing mode, and start editing the wiki.
